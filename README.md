# Matplotlib-Challenge

Observations:

Capomulin had the lowest tumor volume (22.05) at the final timepoint out of the drug list of Capomulin, 
Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin.

Potential outliers for final tumor volume could be as low as 3.07 and as high as 94.04.

The mean and median for tumor volume for all drug treatments are fairly similar suggesting that potentially 
few outliers that skew the distribution.


Code Assistance:
Code assistance came from the pymaceuticals_starter code located within the Pymaceuticals folder. Assitance also recieved from Veronica Mueller, TA (Taylor Grafft), and Shahad Rahman.
